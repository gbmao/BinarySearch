#Binary Search Project
This is a simple Java program implementing the binary search algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array.

####Features
Performs binary search on an integer array.

Returns the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

####Future plans
I plan to extend this project to create a phone list application where users can search contacts quickly using binary search.

If you want, I can help you format it nicely or add more sections like how to run or contribute!
